// The Pomodoro® Core Process consists of 6 steps:

// 1. Choose a task you'd like to get done
// Something big, something small, something you’ve been putting off for a million years: it doesn’t matter. What matters is that it’s something that deserves your full, undivided attention.

// 2. Set the Pomodoro® for 25 minutes
// Make a small oath to yourself: I will spend 25 minutes on this task and I will not interrupt myself. You can do it! After all, it’s just 25 minutes.

// 3. Work on the task until the Pomodoro® rings
// Immerse yourself in the task for the next 25 minutes. If you suddenly realize you have something else you need to do, write the task down on a sheet of paper.

// 4. When the Pomodoro® rings, put a checkmark on a paper
// Congratulations! You’ve spent an entire, interruption-less Pomodoro® on a task.

// 5. Take a short break
// Breathe, meditate, grab a cup of coffee, go for a short walk or do something else relaxing (i.e., not work-related). Your brain will thank you later.

// 6. Every 4 pomodoros, take a longer break
// Once you’ve completed four pomodoros, you can take a longer break. 20 minutes is good. Or 30. Your brain will use this time to assimilate new information and rest before the next round of Pomodoros.
